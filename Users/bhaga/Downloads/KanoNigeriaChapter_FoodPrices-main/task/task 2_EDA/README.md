# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Food Prices in Nigeria

**Project Overview:**

This EDA project focuses on analyzing historical food prices in Nigeria using machine learning techniques and Python programming. The objective is to gain valuable insights into historical food price trends, geographical distribution, category-wise and commodity-wise analysis, and correlations to assist consumers, policymakers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions.

**Findings:**

1. **Geographical Distribution:** The majority of data points were collected from the northern region of Nigeria, indicating regional concentration.

2. **State Analysis:** Data was collected from 14 out of 32 states, with variations in the number of records across states.

3. **Category Analysis:** "Cereals and tubers" had the highest representation in the dataset, followed by "Pulses and nuts" and "Vegetables and fruits."

4. **Commodity Analysis:** "Millet" was the most frequently occurring commodity, followed by "Rice (imported)" and "Rice (local)."

5. **Year Analysis:** The dataset spans from 2002 to 2023, with certain years having higher representation.

6. **Market Name Analysis:** Certain markets, like "Potiskum," had more records than others, indicating regional variations in data collection.

7. **Retail vs. Wholesale Analysis:** Availability of retail and wholesale prices varies across food categories.

8. **Correlation Analysis:** A modest positive correlation was found between NGN food prices and inflation.

9. **Currency Comparison:** A very weak positive correlation was observed between food prices in NGN and USD.

10. **Price Distribution by State:** The analysis revealed variations in food prices across different states, with Abia, Adamawa, and Kebbi having notably higher prices.

11. **Price Distribution by Category:** Certain food categories were associated with higher prices, such as "Milk and dairy," "oil and fats," and "meat, fish, and eggs."

12. **Price Distribution by Food Commodity:** Notable price variations were observed among different commodities, with "Yam (Abuja)" having the highest price.

13. **Price Distribution by Season:** Food prices exhibited seasonal fluctuations, with the "Peak Rainy Season" having the highest prices.

14. **Outliers Detection:** The boxplots of sale's prices grouped by the 'unit' column, shows that there are outlier values on the prices of 'yam', 'bread', and 'eggs' commodity.
